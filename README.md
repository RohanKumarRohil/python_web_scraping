# python_web_scraping
Python web scraping project for winter break 2017

# Milestone 1
Requests, Beautiful Soup and Pagination: Writing a simple script that that extracts quotes from http://quotes.toscrape.com/ and follows pagination links.  
Watch this excellent [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkA1cWN4DEc&list=PLZyvi_9gamL-EE3zQJbU5N3nzJcfNeFHU&index=1) that achieves the exact same functionality using a python library called scrapy. However for milestone 1, we will be using requests and BeautifulSoup4 libraries only. Brief tutorials for both are attached here:
* [Requests](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkA1cWN4DEc&list=PLZyvi_9gamL-EE3zQJbU5N3nzJcfNeFHU&index=1)
